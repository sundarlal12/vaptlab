  {
    q: "What is PCI-DSS penetration testing?",
    a: "PCI-DSS penetration testing is a security assessment that simulates real cyber attacks on your payment systems to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited to steal credit card information. This testing is required by PCI-DSS standards and must be performed at least annually or after significant system changes."
  },
  {
    q: "Who needs PCI-DSS penetration testing?",
    a: "Any organization that processes, stores, or transmits credit card data must comply with PCI-DSS requirements, including penetration testing. This includes merchants, service providers, payment processors, and any business that handles cardholder data."
  },
  {
    q: "What areas are tested during PCI-DSS penetration testing?",
    a: "We test all systems within the cardholder data environment (CDE) including web applications, payment processing systems, network infrastructure, wireless networks, and any systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data."
  },
  {
    q: "How often should PCI-DSS penetration testing be performed?",
    a: "PCI-DSS requires penetration testing at least annually and after any significant changes to the network or applications. High-risk environments may require more frequent testing to maintain compliance and security."
