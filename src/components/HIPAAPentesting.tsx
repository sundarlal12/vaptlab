    overview: `HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a federal law that protects sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without patient consent or knowledge. It applies to healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who handle Protected Health Information (PHI). HIPAA requires organizations to implement appropriate safeguards to protect patient data.`,
    requirements: `HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic PHI (ePHI). Key requirements include access controls, audit controls, integrity controls, person or entity authentication, and transmission security. Organizations must also conduct regular security assessments, implement workforce training, and maintain incident response procedures.`,
    testing: `Our HIPAA penetration testing evaluates your organization's security controls and measures for protecting patient health information. We assess systems, applications, and networks that handle ePHI to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches. Our testing helps ensure your security measures meet HIPAA requirements and protect patient privacy effectively.`,
