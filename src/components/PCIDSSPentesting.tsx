    overview: `PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security requirements created by major credit card companies to protect payment card information. Any business that processes, stores, or transmits credit card data must follow these standards. The standard includes 12 specific security requirements that help protect customer payment information from hackers and data breaches.`,
    testing: `PCI-DSS penetration testing is a security assessment that simulates real cyber attacks on your payment systems. Our security experts try to find weaknesses in your applications and networks that hackers could use to steal credit card information. This testing is required by PCI-DSS standards and must be done at least once a year or whenever you make significant changes to your payment systems.`,
    compliance: `VAPTlabs helps your business meet PCI-DSS compliance requirements through comprehensive security testing. We identify security gaps in your payment processing systems and provide clear guidance on how to fix them. Our expert team ensures your business meets all 12 PCI-DSS requirements, giving you confidence that your payment systems are secure and compliant.`,
    areas: `We focus on testing the most critical areas of your payment environment. This includes checking for weak security settings in your applications and networks, ensuring proper access controls are in place, finding unauthorized wireless networks, and identifying common web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting that could expose payment data.`,
    controls: `Our testing verifies that your authentication and session management systems work properly to prevent unauthorized access to payment data. We check that user login systems are secure, session timeouts work correctly, and that only authorized personnel can access sensitive cardholder information. Proper access controls are essential for PCI-DSS compliance.`,
    encryption: `We evaluate how well your systems protect payment data through encryption and other security measures. Our experts check that credit card numbers are properly encrypted when stored and transmitted, verify that encryption keys are managed securely, and ensure that sensitive data is protected according to PCI-DSS requirements throughout your entire payment processing environment.`
