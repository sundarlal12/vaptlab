This includes license information, version numbers, where they're used, and how they connect to each other. This detailed documentation helps you understand exactly what external code is in your application.`,
    accuracy: `The accuracy of our component detection depends on our extensive security database. We use multiple scanning methods and keep our databases current to ensure we find components correctly and provide reliable information about your software dependencies.`,
    vulnerability: `Our analysis tool identifies known security weaknesses in your external components, including publicly reported vulnerabilities (CVEs). We provide clear information about each security issue, its severity level, and how it might affect your application.`,
    alerts: `We send immediate alerts and notifications to your administrators and security teams about discovered vulnerabilities or license compliance issues. These alerts help you respond quickly to security problems and maintain compliance with your organization's requirements.`,
    policy: `Our advanced tools compare found components against your defined security and compliance rules. We can automatically prevent deployments to production or notify team members to speed up fixes when policy violations are detected.`,
    integration: `Our analysis tools work smoothly with your development pipelines to automatically scan projects with each code change. This continuous monitoring ensures that new security issues are found early in the development process, reducing overall security risks.`

              <strong>Software Composition Analysis (SCA)    </strong> is a process that automatically checks the open-source software used in your applications. The goal is to manage risks, find security issues, and make sure licensing rules are followed.
<br></br>
Since open-source components are now widely used in almost every industry, keeping track of them is very important to protect companies from vulnerabilities and other problems. Because modern software development relies so heavily on open source, doing this manually is not practical. Thatâ€™s why automated tools are used to scan source code, libraries, and dependencies to detect risks quickly and accurately.
